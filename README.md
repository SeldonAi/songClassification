## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to classify songs into genres based on their lyrics. This approach utilizes pre-trained language models, offering insights into the semantic nuances within song lyrics. The project explores both traditional methods based on audio signals and innovative approaches focusing on lyrical content.

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- `report.pdf': The report of the project.
## Models and Experiments

We utilized several machine learning and deep learning models including:
- Baseline models (e.g., Feedforward Neural Networks)
- Recurrent Neural Models (e.g., GRUs)
- Pre-trained Language Models (e.g., DistilRoBERTa and DistilGPT2)

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Genius Song Lyrics Dataset, available on Kaggle, featuring a diverse collection of song lyrics that required preprocessing for effective model training.
